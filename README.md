# Welcome the the *RECON* scripts for *Argus*

This project hosts the development of scripts used for generating analysis
reports for WHO's *Argus* system.

## R packages
R libraries are managed by `packrat`.

## Other requirements

1. Selenium & Docker
In order to render plotly to SVG the docker image with Chrome and Selenium is used.

To install docker please see: https://ropensci.github.io/RSelenium/articles/RSelenium-docker.html

If the docker is already installed pull the image `selenium/standalone-chrome`:
`docker pull selenium/standalone-chrome` from the dockerhub.

To run the docker with the project the project folder (left side) needs to be visible to the docker under the same path as locally:
`docker run -d -p 4445:4444 -v ~/[PROJECT_DIRECTORY]:/[PROJECT_DIRECTORY] selenium/standalone-chrome`

2. For Unix-alikes, GDAL (>= 2.0.0), GEOS (>= 3.3.0) and Proj.4 (>= 4.8.0) are required.

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable`

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev`

3. Pandoc (>= 1.16.0.2) (for `rmarkdown`)

4. R (>= 3.4.1)

## Internationalization

It is possible to generate the reports in different languages. The internationalization is done by `shiny.i18n` package. User needs to provide the translations in the csv file:
`src/translations/translations.csv`. Raw column contains the alias for the translation for R this shouldn't be modified in the csv (unless also modified in R). To add new translation add new column with the language and provide the translations.

## Workflow

Whole workflow is controlled using `src/master.R` file.
Master file contains comments for every block of logic.

**First please set required environment variables.**
You can do this using export from your terminal:

`export ARGUS_DATA_API_USER_NAME="" ARGUS_DATA_API_PASSWORD="" ARGUS_DATA_API_LOCALE="en" ARGUS_CHROME_DOWNLOAD_DIR="[PROJECT_DIRECTORY]/src/assets" ARGUS_DASHBOARD_LOCALE="en"`

`*_API_*` - are data API related settings
`ARGUS_CHROME_DOWNLOAD_DIR` - is the location where svg plots are saved
`ARGUS_DASHBOARD_LOCALE` - is the language of the reports. This needs to correspond to column names in the `src/translations/translations.csv`. Use "en" to translate to English.

**Run docker with Selenium and Chrome**
`docker run -d -p 4445:4444 -v ~/[PROJECT_DIRECTORY]:/[PROJECT_DIRECTORY] selenium/standalone-chrome`

**To run the workflow:**
`Rscript src/master.R`

### Master script steps:

1. Generating dashboard raw input
Produce R object that are further prepocessed to produce the final output (charts and tables) for the reports.

Run `[PROJECT_DIRECTORY]/src/dashboard_input_script/argus_dashboard_raw_input_script.R` this will produce 2 RData raw inputs for administrative and epidemiological report in `[PROJECT_DIRECTORY]/src/assets`.

2. Preprocessing
In order to minimize the size of the report charts and tables are preprocessed outside the Rmd files.

Run `[PROJECT_DIRECTORY]/src/dashboard_input_scripts/epidemiological_dashboard_input` to generate input for epidemiological report.

Run `[PROJECT_DIRECTORY]/src/dashboard_input_scripts/adimistrative_dashboard_input` to generate input for administrative report.

3. Rendering the dashboards
In order to render the dashboards knit the `[PROJECT_DIRECTORY]/src/reports/administrative_dashboard.Rmd` and `[PROJECT_DIRECTORY]/src/reports/epidemiological_dashboard.Rmd`.
